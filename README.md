## :blue_heart:   AccessAbled   :blue_heart:
AccessAbled makes London accessible to all members of society. It is like Tripadvisor but focuses on what people with disabilities look for when deciding to visit a London attraction. Frontend written in React.js with vanilla CSS, no styling packages were imported, and backend written in Ruby on Rails. Cloudinary was used to upload images and store them. Google Maps API was used to display attraction locations and tube stations. Data Scraping along with an XML file provided by TFL (Transport For London) was used to extract information about the accessibility of every tube stop in London and London attractions. This data was then used to create AccessAbled’s unique database.

## Motivation
During one of my projects at University I was lucky enough to work with the Australian Paralympic committee and a couple of their rugby wheelchair athletes. One afternoon during testing we got talking and they mentioned their trip to London. They loved the city, however, they all agreed that the transport and general awareness for people with disabilities was low compared to other cities. I at the time hadn't thought much about how London attractions accomodate people in wheelchairs and those without sight or have trouble hearing. So I looked into it and found that generally speaking each attraction has a page on their website detailing its accessability, however, there wasn't a website or application out there that got all this information for each attraction and put it in one place. This is were AccessAbled comes in!

Accessabled provides information to people about an attractions accessibility from the type of door at the main entrance to nearest accessible tube stops and what line is it accessible via. It is also possible to leave reviews and even add attractions that aren't on the website already.

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
